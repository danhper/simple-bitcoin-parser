## sample-bitcoin-parser

This is a sample implementation of a Bitcoin parser in Python able to parse
blocks, transactions and Merkle proofs.

This is meant to be used as a reference for the following blog post:  
http://daniel.perez.sh/blog/2020/bitcoin-format/

The happy path should work for all functions but no error handling is performed.
This is therefore not meant to be used directly but can be a good starting point
or reference to implement such a parser.
